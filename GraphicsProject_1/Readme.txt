I have attempted almost all of the questions

The Scene Depicts a empty space where an abandoned shipyard is present surrounded by asteroids and floating objects
(the bunny and other things) in space and few ships are going around and searching the place.

How to Build - The Solution "K2_Engine.sln" should be build (works both in debug and release).

You can change the attributes with models_attributes.txt and it will change the position , rotation , colour, scale, toggle color

this is an example of the attibutes in text
AsteroidExtra4 102.0 -40.0 150.0 5.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.04 0
